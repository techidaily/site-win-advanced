When I try to enter a double quote mark, ie, “, I have to follow it with a space or the next character gets an omlaut. All I want is a double quote mark when and where I type it.  
 How can I disable this behaviour?  
 Thanks… Bob

Hi Bob,  
I never encounter this problem.  
    
 This looks like you have set a snippet(\*) with a quote mark as trigger?  
    
 And, you should always mention your environment to help tracking this down:  
 OS?, Bitness?, Language?, EE version?, portable or installed? Which configuration/Syntax? Where do you enter the quote? …? …?

Hi Stefan,  
 Not unreasonable to want to know version etc:  
 Win 7  
 64 bits  
 EE Version 14.4.2  
 English  
 To my knowledge I have no snippets  
 This is a recently rebuilt after a crash computer. Previously I had the same version. This was a clean, new install.  
 It is as if there is an accenting feature turned on:  
 Enter the sequence: double quote and space > get a double quote  
 Enter the sequence: double quote and E > get an E with umlaut Ë  
 Enter the sequence: double quote and A > get an A with umlaut Ä  
 There could be a windows “Feature” that is doing this.  
 Thanks… Bob

The answer is: My win7 was shipped with the US-International Keyboard. When changed to just US the problem goes away.

Hmm, this could be a macro with event “Character Inserted” or like that.  
 Check menu “Macros > Customize…” if there is a macro listed which have a event assigned.  
    
 Or perhaps you run a “automation” tool like AutohotKey or like that.  
 Check from Task Manager (Crl+Shift+Esc)  
    
    
 Are you the only one who work on this PC? ;D  
    
 I get no better ideas right now…

Hi Stefan, I solved it. See my other posts. Perhaps our postings crossed in the ether,  
Thanks… Bob
